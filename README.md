# Btrfs-Guard
Btrfs-Guard is a Bash script designed to simplify the process of creating snapshots of Btrfs subvolumes. This script automates the creation of snapshots, making it easier to manage and protect your data on Btrfs filesystems.

## Usage:
To create a snapshot, simply run the script with the UUID of the Btrfs filesystem and the name of the subvolume.

Example:

    ./btrfs-guard.sh <uuid> <subvolume>
